# raspberrypi-services
Pack of little services that can be run on raspberry pi written in python.

I am trying to learn python and I decided to write a lot of little services/scripts/programs that can be run by systemd. They are ment to run all the time and tak care of checking status of postal packages, temperature of RPi board, disc/ram usage etc. When certain conditions are met push notification/email is sent and/or message will be printed on a thermal printer connected to raspberry. 

Things I am about to implement:

- [ ] board temperature monitor
- [ ] free space/ram monitor
- [ ] postal package monitor
- [ ] events/apointments remainder (days off, public holidays, birthdays etc.)
- [ ] movies in cinemas
